# Where is my GitHub avatar?
### Q: Why donâ€™t you have a GitHub avatar?
### A: Because they want me to sign up for a WordPress account to update my GitHub avatar which makes no earthly sense.

*UPDATED*

You can now upload an avatar directly to GitHub. Sometimes hard work and perseverance pay off.
